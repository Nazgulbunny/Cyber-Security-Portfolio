# H2 Portfolio Activity: Draft a professional statement
_A professional statement is an introduction to employers that briefly describes who you are and what you care about. It lets you showcase your cybersecurity interest, work experience, knowledge, skills, and achievements._

Amidst the ever-expanding universe of tech, my presence is a beacon of dedication, knowledge, and passion. With over a decade of hands-on experience, I'm not just another face in the crowd. I'm a seasoned leader, a Group Product Manager, an Enterprise Coach, and a fervent advocate for growth in both personal and professional dimensions. My professional roles transcend mere titles; they resonate with a calling, an unwavering commitment to the evolution of the tech domain.

My expertise is a unique amalgamation of roles in product management, project management, agile practices, and enterprise coaching, Techncal skills like SQL, Linux and programming languages substantiated with a plethora of certifications like PMP, Certified Scrum Product Owner, Certified Scrum Professional, Agile Coach, Certified Scrum Master, and certification in Cybersecurity, among others. And if that wasn’t eclectic enough, I’m also an accredited insurance and reinsurance broker for the Italian market.

Having spearheaded numerous projects, my experience stretches across the video game and casino landscape, e-commerce, delivery services, AI, machine learning, and the realms of finance, encompassing insurance and banking. While leading foundational technical teams, I've emphasised app performance & reliability and release, frontend infrastructure, developer experience, customer identity and security and the intricacies of automation.

Throughout these ventures, collaboration has been my compass. I've had the privilege to synergize with analysts, designers, engineers, data scientists, fellow product and project managers, and the echelons of executive leadership. 

A metrics lover at heart, I'm laser-focused on Data and OKRs, developing them to gauge efficacy, success, and vital KPIs. Tracking critical KPIs like DAU, MAU, ARPU, and LTV, product specifications, and mapping out project milestones have all been in a day's work. 
The foundation of all these endeavours? My unparalleled management and leadership skills. The trust, open communication, and shared knowledge I instil within my teams have always yielded productivity and innovation.

Beyond the world of tech, my quill has often been my voice. I am a published author of two insightful books and an avid writer on Medium. My writings traverse through the intricacies of product management, project management, leadership, coaching, mentoring, and more. 

Investment is another arena where I exercise both my analytical prowess and risk-taking appetite. Sharing insights via my eToro portfolio, I relish the thrill of strategic investment. But it doesn't end there. I wear the hat of an advisor, sometimes a consultant, and when the stars align, even a co-founder, fervently supporting startups and young entrepreneurs even as an investor.

Now, stepping aside from the professional spectrum, my heart finds joy in the fantastical realms of role-playing games, board games, and fantasy literature. These passions not only serve as my creative escape but also fuel my professional creativity, adding a unique flavour to all that I do.

Last but not least I enjoy spending time in nature hiking with my dog and doing sport.

At the core of my multifaceted journey, the essence remains consistent: fostering collaboration, nurturing growth, and promoting innovation. Imbued with a spirit of trust, open communication, and shared knowledge, I'm here to make waves, driven by my guiding principle: Listen, learn, innovate, and never give 

My core values are deeply rooted in honesty, integrity, and collaboration, principles that guide my professional endeavours and personal interactions. I am committed to ensuring that in every project we undertake, our team diligently works towards achieving the highest standards of excellence for our clients, stakeholders, and the world at large. This commitment extends beyond mere words; it is a steadfast pledge to act with transparency, uphold ethical practices in all circumstances, and foster a collaborative environment where collective effort and shared knowledge lead to innovative solutions. In doing so, I aim to contribute positively to our community and society, making a meaningful difference by setting a benchmark for how businesses can operate responsibly and with a purpose that transcends profit—striving to create a better, safer, and more equitable world for everyone.

My journey across various roles and industries has culminated in a profound realization: cybersecurity is where my passion, skills, and values align, presenting the definitive arena for my next professional venture. In a world increasingly digitized, cybersecurity emerges as the critical battleground against the 'bad boys' of the digital age. My resolve to confront these challenges head-on stems from a deep-seated commitment to safeguarding individuals and organizations from harm, embodying the principles of integrity, collaboration, and vigilance.

My diverse background, while eclectic, has never fully satisfied my quest for an environment that could harness my entire skill set, stimulate my intellectual curiosity to its fullest, and offer a clear, impactful purpose—until now. Discovering cybersecurity has been a revelation, unveiling a field that not only demands a comprehensive application of my abilities but also resonates with my core values of ensuring safety and upholding justice in the digital realm.

I firmly believe that my multifaceted skills can significantly contribute to making cybersecurity teams more efficient, cohesive, and driven by a unified vision. My keen attention to detail and analytical prowess are tailored for identifying and mitigating potential threats, ensuring that organizations and governments can operate within a secure digital landscape. Furthermore, my expertise in project management, risk assessment, and a thorough understanding of process frameworks and data legislation positions me as a valuable asset in crafting strategies that preempt regulatory pitfalls and fines.

In essence, my transition into cybersecurity is not merely a career shift but a commitment to a cause greater than myself. It's about leveraging my accumulated knowledge and skills to foster a secure, trustworthy digital environment for all. As I embark on this new chapter, I am eager to contribute to and grow within this dynamic field, confronting cybersecurity challenges head-on with diligence, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.
